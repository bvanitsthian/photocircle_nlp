As an NLP and ML enthusiast, I am constantly seeking new and exciting challenges to push the boundaries of my knowledge and skill set. This analysis presents an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and explore the unchartered waters of NLP in tandem with ML. My primary motivation is to create a significant impact on individuals or organizations, and this analysis aligns perfectly with my objective.

I am intrigued by the unique challenge of comprehending a user base with minimal data, and I am eager to apply my expertise to uncover meaningful insights. My ultimate goal is to help the photo-sharing app make better advertising decisions that will result in increased revenue. I am excited to collaborate with the app's creator to deliver valuable recommendations that will elevate the app's user experience and establish a competitive edge.

The objective of this analysis is to assist a fast-growing photo-sharing app in understanding its user base as much as possible given little information about each user. The app does not collect personal information from its users. However, they have information on their users' registered display names, email domain registration (i.e. @edu are likely to be students), and photo album titles. The app's creator made the following assumptions: 
Email domains registered with.edu tend to be student 
photo album names with any Greek words tend to be connected with sorority/fraternity users


Known issues include: 
1. Identifying M/F individuals based on their display names 
2. Segmenting users based on photo album names does not always translate to users' principal interests


Insights from this research will help the company increase its revenue by focusing their advertising efforts where they will be most effective.

The data questions this analysis seeks to answer include:
1. Given the photo album titles, what distinct user segments can be identified? 
2. How can we determine the gender distribution of the user base and the number of registered students?
3. What type of users are most active?
